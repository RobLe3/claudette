## 🚀 Immediate Deployment Instructions

### Emergency Release (Recommended First Steps)

1. **Create Emergency Release**:
   ```bash
   # Emergency release with full validation
   ./scripts/emergency-release.sh -e 2.1.5
   
   # Or dry-run first to validate pipeline
   ./scripts/emergency-release.sh -d -e 2.1.5
   ```

2. **Manual GitHub Actions Trigger**:
   - Go to Actions tab → "Emergency Release Pipeline"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter version: `v2.1.5`
   - Select "Emergency release" if needed
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Verification Steps**:
   ```bash
   # Verify installation methods
   ./scripts/test-installation.sh -v 2.1.5
   
   # Validate specific platforms
   ./scripts/validate-artifacts.sh -p linux -a x64 -v 2.1.5 -d ./artifacts
   ```
