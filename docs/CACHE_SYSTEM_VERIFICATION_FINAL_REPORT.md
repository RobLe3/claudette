   - Configuration system: ✅ Flexible and extensible

### Areas for Refinement ⚠️

1. **Database Persistence Layer**
   - Database queries may need schema alignment
   - Cross-session persistence needs validation
   - Error handling in database operations could be improved

2. **Concurrency Handling**
   - High-volume concurrent access patterns need optimization
   - Race condition handling under extreme load

## Recommendations

### 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY
