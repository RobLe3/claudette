# Graph-Based Problem Solving Architecture for Claudette
## Meta-Cognitive AI: Mapping Problem-Solving Processes as Graph Structures

### Executive Summary
This document outlines a revolutionary approach to enhance Claudette's AI capabilities by modeling problem-solving processes themselves as graph structures. This meta-cognitive architecture enables the system to understand, optimize, and reason about reasoning itself.

## 🧠 The Meta-Cognitive Vision

### Beyond Simple AI Routing
**Current Paradigm**: AI middleware routes requests to backends
**Meta-Cognitive Paradigm**: AI system models and optimizes its own problem-solving processes

### Core Concept: Problem-Solving as Graph Navigation
Every problem-solving process can be represented as a graph where:
- **Nodes** = Problem states, sub-problems, concepts, solutions
- **Edges** = Reasoning steps, logical connections, transformations
- **Paths** = Solution strategies, reasoning chains, cognitive flows

- Add analogical reasoning across domains
- Implement complex problem decomposition
- Build explanation and transparency features

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization (Weeks 10-12)
- Full integration with Claudette's AI pipeline
- Performance optimization and scaling
- Real-world testing and refinement

This meta-cognitive architecture transforms Claudette from an AI router into a **self-aware, learning problem-solving system** that continuously improves its own reasoning capabilities through graph-based analysis of cognitive processes. 🧠🚀
