## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-18

### üîí Security Fixes

#### Log Injection Prevention
- **Enhanced Secure Logging** - Added comprehensive log sanitization to prevent injection attacks
  - Removes control characters (newlines, carriage returns, ANSI escape sequences)
  - Sanitizes potential log format patterns ([ADMIN], [FAKE], [INJECTED], etc.)
  - Limits log entry length to prevent flooding attacks
  - Automatically masks API keys and sensitive data in all log outputs
- **Updated Vulnerable Logging Calls** - Replaced raw console.warn/error with SecureLogger.secureLog
  - Fixed log injection in connection pool warmup failures
  - Secured backend registration error logging
  - Enhanced error message sanitization in Qwen backend

#### Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed Progress Tracker Logic Error** - Corrected unreachable condition in setup time recommendations
  - Issue: `else if (deviationPercent > 50)` was unreachable after `if (deviationPercent > 20)`
  - Fixed: Reordered conditions to check > 50% before > 20% deviation
  - Impact: Users with severely delayed setups now get appropriate "skip optional steps" guidance
- **Improved Setup Wizard Assertions** - Replaced unnecessary null checks with meaningful validation
  - Removed: `assert(wizard !== null)` (always true for new object instances)
  - Added: `assert(wizard instanceof SetupWizard)` and method existence checks
  - Better error messages for actual initialization failures

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Enhancements
- **Log Injection Protection**: All user-controlled data in logs is now sanitized
