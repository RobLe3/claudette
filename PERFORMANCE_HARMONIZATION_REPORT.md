## 🛠 Implementation Overview

### 1. Unified Performance System (`src/monitoring/unified-performance-system.ts`)

Created a comprehensive performance monitoring framework with:

**Core Features**:
- **Standardized Timing Categories**: 11 performance categories (initialization, backend_operation, cache_operation, etc.)
- **Performance Thresholds**: Defined excellent/good/acceptable/slow thresholds for each category
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatic performance snapshots every 30 seconds
- **Component Profiling**: Individual performance profiles for each component
- **Correlation Tracking**: Parent-child timer relationships for detailed analysis

**Key Metrics**:
```typescript
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  INITIALIZATION: { excellent: 1000, good: 3000, acceptable: 10000, slow: 30000 },
  BACKEND_OPERATION: { excellent: 500, good: 2000, acceptable: 5000, slow: 15000 },
  CACHE_OPERATION: { excellent: 10, good: 50, acceptable: 200, slow: 1000 },
  MCP_OPERATION: { excellent: 1000, good: 5000, acceptable: 15000, slow: 45000 }
}
```

### 2. Timeout Management System (`src/monitoring/timeout-manager.ts`)

Standardized timeout handling across all operations:

**Standardized Timeouts**:
- **Initialization**: 30s for system startup
- **Backend Health Check**: 5.5s with retry logic
- **MCP Operations**: 60s for requests, 15s for server startup
- **Cache Operations**: 500ms reads, 1s writes
- **Database Operations**: 5s queries, 60s migrations

**Advanced Features**:
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry strategies (linear, exponential, fixed)
- **Warning Thresholds**: Early warnings at 80% of timeout
- **Custom Handlers**: Component-specific timeout behavior
- **Performance Integration**: Automatic timing correlation

### 3. Performance Harmonizer (`src/monitoring/performance-harmonizer.ts`)

Component orchestration and optimization system:

**Component Profiles**:
- **claudette-core**: 50 max concurrent ops, 5s max average time
- **backend-manager**: 20 max concurrent ops, 10s max average time  
- **mcp-server**: 10 max concurrent ops, 20s max average time
- **cache-system**: 100 max concurrent ops, 500ms max average time

**Convenience Functions**:
```typescript
harmonizedBackendOperation(backendName, operation, fn, metadata)
harmonizedCacheOperation(operation, fn, metadata)
harmonizedMCPOperation(operation, fn, metadata)
```
